# Programming in Haskell

[Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) is a book by
Graham Hutton. This is my attempt at the exercises for the second edition.

## Building

```
stack build
```

## Running Tests

```
stack test
```

## Development Environment

See the [Haskell IDE Engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine) and
[Editor
Integration](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine#editor-integration). I've
only tested VSCode and Emacs.
